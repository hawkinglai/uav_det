UAV detection under yolov8<br>
The dataset is avaliable in https://github.com/Jake-WU/Det-Fly.<br>
Fyi, the dataset need to be splited manually<br>
# IMPORTANT
This is the code for UAV detection, and implement Loss Landscape in YOLOv8.<br>
This a unclean code for generating loss landscape. You need to modified some code in your scienario.<br>
If the code does not work due to version update, here are some following steps you could reproduce the code: <br>
<1> modified the validators -> get the loss value <br>
<2> run model.val -> get the direction dictionary <br>
<3> run the main.py in the file PlotLoss. <br>

If you use our implementation of Loss Landscape in YOLOv8
plz cite our work, thanks!
